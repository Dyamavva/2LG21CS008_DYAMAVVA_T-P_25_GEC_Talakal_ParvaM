                    Thus, our surroundings refer to our environment, which constitutes the organism, materials, and energies. The environment provides the favorable conditions for living organisms to live and grow. The entire organism wants to survive with a consistent supply of resources and the elimination of waste.
                    
                    The biotic (living organism) and abiotic (non-living organism) are included in the environment. The climate, the weather, and the natural resources have a direct impact on human existence, and economic activities are included in this environment.</p>
